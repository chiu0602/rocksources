Description: Camera DBus service for USB Video Camera (UVC).

This service is based on GUVCViewer 1.x and GTK2.
It wraps GUVCViewer (remove unused UI) in a DBus service.
Via DBus, you can open a webcam with a monitor window and capture picture.

If your main environment is GTK3, you should try GUVCViewer 2.x.
GUVCViewer 2 provides libraries to embed webcam's view in your application and to control camera.
