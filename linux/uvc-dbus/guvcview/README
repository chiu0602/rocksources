GTK UVC VIEWER (guvcview)
*************************

Basic Configuration
===================

*Data Files:
------------
(language files; image files; gnome menu entry)

guvcview data files are stored by default to /usr/local/share
setting a different prefix (--prefix=BASEDIR) during configuration
will change the installation path to BASEDIR/share.

Built files, src/guvcview and pixmaps/gnome.desktop, are dependent 
on this path, so if a new prefix is set a make clean is required 
before issuing the make command. 

After running the configure script the normal, make | make install 
should build and install all the necessary files.    
    
 
*guvcview bin:
--------------
(src/guvcview)

The binarie file installs to the standart location,
/usr/local/bin, to change the install path, configure
must be executed with --prefix=DIR set, this will cause
the bin file to be installed in DIR/bin, make sure 
DIR/bin is set in your PATH variable, or the gnome 
menu entry will fail.


*guvcview.desktop:
------------------

(pixmaps/guvcview.desktop)

The desktop file (gnome menu entry) is built from the
pixmaps/Makefile.am definition and is dependent on the 
configure --prefix setting, any changes to this, must 
be done in pixmaps/Makefile.am, the file must be removed 
(make clean) before building a new one with the make command.



Executing guvcview
================== 

For instructions on the command line args 
execute "guvcview --help".

Detailed information will be added in future 
versions.
